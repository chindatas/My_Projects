The purpose for this project is to provide a platform to display my knowledge of 
sql querying, pyhton, pandas, and visualization skills with seaborn.

The data set only has two tables.  This project will query and combine features from those tables to form a single dataframe to work with.
The goal is to display skillsets such as finding and addressing bad values, creating new columns, using both sql and pandas techniques to transform data for visualization.

There are 3 notebooks one is a project template I prefer to start with, another is a messy exploration notebook.
The notebook labeled Cleaned.ipynb is the final project.

Future projects will contain a greater use of statistcal analysis.

Thank You for viewing this project.
